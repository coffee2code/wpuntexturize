Prevent WordPress from displaying single and double quotation marks as their curly alternatives.

== Description ==

Prevent WordPress from displaying single and double quotation marks as their curly alternatives.

Despite the unfortunately misleading name, this plugin is NOT the antithesis of WordPress's `wptexturize()` function.  This ONLY prevents WordPress from making HTML entity code substitutions of single and double quotation marks with their curly alternatives and does NOT prevent `wptexturize()` from making any other character and string substitutions. 

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `wpuntexturize.zip` inside the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or upload `wpuntexturize.php` to `/wp-content/plugins/`
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why are certain characters in my posts still being replaced by their HTML entity encoded version? =
