# TODO

The following list comprises ideas, suggestions, and known issues, all of which are in consideration for possible implementation in future releases.

***This is not a roadmap or a task list.*** Just because something is listed does not necessarily mean it will ever actually get implemented. Some might be bad ideas. Some might be impractical. Some might either not benefit enough users to justify the effort or might negatively impact too many existing users. Or I may not have the time to devote to the task.

* Remove pre-WP5.5 back-compatibility
* Add setting to allow admins to define additional filters that should be handled by the plugin
* Rename the plugin to reflect its true purpose since it really isn't the antithesis of wptexturize
  * e.g. "Disable Curly Quotes"
  * Or, actually make it the antithesis of wptexturize and allow users to selectively disable all its character conversions
    * Even if so, "texturize" has no meaning to people. Maybe call it "Disable Character Conversions"

Feel free to make your own suggestions or champion for something already on the list (via the [plugin's support forum on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wpuntexturize/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/coffee2code/wpuntexturize/) as an issue or PR).
